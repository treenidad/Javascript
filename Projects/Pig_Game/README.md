# A 2-player game that keeps track of scores.

-----RULES-----
- Each player rolls a 6-sided dice on their turn.
- Each roll corresponds to how many points the player will receive.
- After each roll, the player can decide to either continue rolling the dice to earn more points, or to 'hold' the current amount of points they have.
- Rolling any number between '2' to '6' will give the player the appropriate points while a '1' will cause the player to lose their current points and their turn.
- When a player chooses to 'hold', their points are 'banked' and their turn ends.
- First player to reach 21 points wins.
