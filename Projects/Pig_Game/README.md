# A 2-player game that keeps track of scores.

---RULES---
Each player rolls a 6-sided dice on their turn.
Each roll corresponds to how many points the player has accumulated thus far.
After each roll, the player can decide to either continue rolling the dice, or to 'hold' the amount of points they currently have.
Rolling any number between '2' to '6' will give the player the appropriate points while a '1' will cause the player to lose their current points and their turn.
When a player chooses to 'hold' their points are 'banked' and their turn ends.
First player to reach 21 points wins.
